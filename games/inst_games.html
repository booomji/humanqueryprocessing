	<h2>Group 1</h2>
	Remember: you are pretending to be a robot!  Follow the instructions closely, even if they seem unnecessary.

	<ol>
	<li>Start your timer
	<li>Look at each row one by one; cross out the row if the Number Sold is &le; 20,000,000
	<li>Look at each row one by one again; if the row is not crossed out,  write the decade of the Release Date in the "Decades" scratch sheet if it is not already written down
	<li>Now you have a list of all the unique decades in the "Decades" scratch sheet!
  <li>For each decade you wrote down:
	<ol>
		<li>Write the decade and the number 0 as a row in the "Counters" scratch sheet
		<li>Look at each row in the list of video games; if the row is not crossed out and the Release Date is in the same decade, then add 1 to the decade's number
	</ol>
  <li>Read through the "Counters" scratch sheet and write the decade with the biggest counter in the "Result" table below.
	<li>Write down how long it took and let Eugene know by raising your hand
	</ol>
	<table>
	<tr><th>Result</th><th>How many minutes did your group take?</th></tr>
